                        <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
                        <p>"I'm currently a final-year Computer Science student at SRMIST with a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and software development. During my academics, I've worked on several projects including a [specific project] where I implemented [technologies], which improved [specific metric] by [percentage].</p>
                        <p>In my recent internship at [Company], I gained hands-on experience with [technologies] and contributed to [specific achievement]. I'm particularly passionate about problem-solving and have solved over 200 DSA problems on LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.</p>
                        <p>I'm excited about IBM because of your innovative work in cloud computing and AI, and I see this role as an excellent opportunity to apply my technical skills while continuing to learn and grow in a global organization."</p>

                        <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
                        <p>"One of my key strengths is problem-solving. During my final year project, we encountered a critical performance bottleneck. I analyzed the code, identified the issue was in our database queries, and optimized them by implementing indexing and caching, which reduced load time by 60%.</p>
                        <p>Another strength is my ability to learn quickly. When our team decided to migrate our project from JavaScript to TypeScript, I took the initiative to learn TypeScript within a week and helped my teammates with the transition.</p>
                        <p>I'm also a strong team player. In our college hackathon, I coordinated with four team members with different skill sets, delegated tasks effectively, and we secured second place among 50 teams."</p>

                        <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
                        <p>"Earlier, I used to struggle with public speaking and presenting my ideas in large groups. I realized this was limiting my ability to share technical concepts effectively.</p>
                        <p>To address this, I've been actively working on it by volunteering to present in class seminars and joining the college's technical club where I've presented twice in front of 100+ students. While I still get a bit nervous, I've become much more confident and received positive feedback on my recent presentations.</p>
                        <p>I've learned that preparation is key - when I thoroughly understand the topic and practice beforehand, I'm able to communicate much more effectively."</p>

                        <p>"During our final year project, we faced a critical challenge two weeks before the deadline. Our application's database was becoming extremely slow as the data size increased, and we were worried about the demo.</p>
                        <p><strong>Situation:</strong> The response time had increased from 2 seconds to 15 seconds, which was unacceptable.</p>
                        <p><strong>Task:</strong> As the backend lead, I had to identify and fix the performance issue quickly.</p>
                        <p><strong>Action:</strong> First, I used profiling tools to identify the bottleneck. I found that our queries weren't optimized and we had no indexing. I spent two days researching database optimization techniques, implemented proper indexing on frequently queried fields, optimized our queries by reducing unnecessary joins, and added caching for frequently accessed data.</p>
                        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The changes reduced response time from 15 seconds to under 2 seconds even with larger datasets. This experience taught me the importance of performance considerations from the beginning and the value of profiling tools. Our project demo went smoothly and we received excellent feedback."</p>
